Minitor (pronounced mine-itor) is an OS X menubar application to monitor dogecoin mining progress via any MPOS (https://github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) API.

Currently it displays your current hashrate in the menubar and your expected payout in the menu.

Grab your API information from the "Edit Account" section of your MPOS of choice and put that into the API section of settings.

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/birarda/minitor/issues) if you come across a bug or want to make any feature suggestions.

Pull requests welcome!

If you like Minitor and would like to donate (which will help me spend more time improving it) feel free to throw some DOGE my way.
